  "body": "Updated to Vim 9.0.0065.\r\n\r\nMacVim is now updated to Vim 9!\r\n\r\nI just want to apologize for the infrequent update cadence for MacVim over the last year and a half. I have not had much time to work on MacVim, which made catching up harder, leading to a bad feedback loop. I would like to move back to a more regular release cadence to keep MacVim more updated relative to Vim, and to be able to start working on macOS 12/13 integrations as well as fixing outstanding bugs and merging the various pull requests that have been waiting to be merged for a while.  Please don't hesitate to poke on GitHub if MacVim starts falling behind again.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- MacVim now supports the `+sodium` feature, which allows you to use the newer \"xchacha20\" encryption method for encryption. See `:help cryptmethod`. #1225\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- Scripting languages versions:\r\n    - Ruby is now built against 3.1, up from 3.0.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Compatibility</summary>\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n====================\r\n\r\nRequires macOS 10.9 or above.\r\n\r\nScript interfaces have compatibility with these versions:\r\n\r\n- Lua 5.4\r\n- Perl 5.18\r\n- Python2 2.7\r\n- Python3 3.9\r\n- Ruby 3.1\r\n</details>\r\n",
