Previously it just forwarded to https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/. You can also now read the MacVim documentation at https://macvim.org/docs/gui_mac.txt.html. #1385\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n====================\r\n\r\nUpdater / What's New page\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThere is now a \"What's New\" page that will automatically be shown whenever MacVim detected that it has been updated to a new version (can be disabled in Settings). The page will also include all the release notes if you have updated across multiple versions. This feature is useful for users who turned on \"Automatically install updates\" or installs MacVim through other methods like Homebrew but would still like to see the release notes when a new version comes out. You can also access it through the Help menu. #1414\r\n\r\nMacVim should now report its version in a much more consistent manner in the \"About MacVim\" page and when the updater reports there is a new version. It should look something like \"r176 (Vim 9.0.1276)\" where \"r176\" is the MacVim release number and the 9.0.1276 is the bundled Vim version. #1293 #1393\r\n\r\nSparkle (updater for MacVim) is now updated to 2.4.2. #1416\r\n\r\nNew Vim features\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- New bundled colorschemes: wildcharm/retrobox/sorbet/zaibatsu (vim/vim#12163)\r\n- File encryption now has a new `cryptmethod`: `xchacha20v2`, which is designed to be more forward compatible with future Vim versions than `xchacha20`.  ([v9.0.1481](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/aae583441bcdbb0bfef3b8a1d193e04ae09ca95d))\r\n- `switchbuf` works for more commands. ([v9.0.1546](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/54be5fb382d2bf25fd1b17ddab8b21f599019b81))\r\n- Statusline now supports multiple alignment \"%=\" items. ([v9.0.1300](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/3ec78f973fdaec2cea8e036ed38037b2fe40670b))\r\n- New UTF-16 utility functions (`strutf16len` and `utf16idx`) ([v9.0.1485](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/67672ef097dd708244ff042a8364994da2b91e75))\r\n- Misc 'smoothscroll' bugs fixes\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n====================\r\n\r\n* Removed non-Unicode localization files, which helps cut down on app size. #1397\r\n* Miscellaneous documentation fixes. #1415 #1375 #1386 #1363 (by @dkav)\r\n* The disk image for MacVim (MacVim.dmg) is now in APFS and uses better compression for better efficiency. #1409\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n====================\r\n\r\n* Printing a file in macOS 13 Ventura (using `:hardcopy` or File\u2192Print) should work again. #1390\r\n* Fixed a broken symlink to XPCServices in the Sparkle framework. #1367\r\n* Fixed MacVim to not throw (safe) Objective C exceptions when quitting. #1371\r\n* Fixed welcome message not being aligned properly in Simplified Chinese and show the Vim 9 prompt. #1381\r\n* Removed some unnecessary test files in the runtime folders which were included erroneously. #1418\r\n\r\nScripting\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- Scripting languages versions:\r\n    - Python is now built against 3.11, up from 3.10.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Compatibility</summary> \r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n====================\r\n\r\nRequires macOS 10.9 or above. (10.9 - 10.12 requires downloading a separate legacy build)\r\n\r\nScript interfaces have compatibility with these versions:\r\n\r\n- Lua 5.4\r\n- Perl 5.30\r\n- Python2 2.7\r\n- Python3 3.11\r\n- Ruby 3.2\r\n</details>",
