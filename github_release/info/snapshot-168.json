  "body": "\u26a0\ufe0f NOTE \u26a0\ufe0f:  This release seems to not run on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or below. Download r166 instead if you have that. See #1138. A fix was released under r169.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdated to Vim 8.2.2127.\r\n\r\n*Note*: This release doesn't natively support Apple Silicon / M1 yet, but does work under Rosetta. See below.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBig Sur / macOS 11\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- MacVim now has an updated app icon (#1054), and preference pane / toolbars have been updated to match Big Sur's interface guidelines. (#1128)\r\n- Fixed Touch Bar warnings when launching MacVim from the terminal.  #1114\r\n- SF Symbol characters will show up properly as double-width as most of these icons would take up more than one column. Note that these characters are specific to macOS and would not work in other platforms. #1129\r\n\r\nRenderer / scrolling performance improvements\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe Core Text renderer has been rewritten and is now much faster!  Scrolling should not stutter and lag like before and generally it should feel a lot smoother now. Thanks to Sidney San Mart\u00edn (@s4y) for the contribution. #858\r\n\r\nWith this change, the non-Core-Text renderer is now considered deprecated. The old renderer is accessible either through the Preference Pane (under Advanced) or by setting the defaults \"MMRenderer\" to 0. It works for now, but it will be removed in a future update as it has known bugs.\r\n\r\nMenu Localization\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nMenus are now localized, see `:h langmenu` for how Vim menu localization works. You can use `set langmenu=none` to turn it off if you would like. #1099\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\"  alt=\"localized menus\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1217449/101893005-f942d680-3b58-11eb-9cf3-96d117c5a370.png\">\r\n\r\nThere still exists a few menu items that are not localized, and the general MacVim GUI is not localized as well. If you would like to help, please use #1102 to coordinate with MacVim dev team.\r\n\r\nGetting help / Help menu\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- Help menu's search bar now searches Vim documentation as well! See #1095.\r\n  \r\n  <img width=\"430\" alt=\"help menu search\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1217449/101957566-86684880-3bb6-11eb-8466-2bf73b3585bd.png\">\r\n\r\n- Vimtutor is now bundled with MacVim, and you can access vimtutor from the Help menu (#1096).\r\n- There is also a link to the latest release notes as well (#1131).\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n====================\r\n\r\nApple Silicon\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThis release does not contain a native universal app for Apple Silicon / M1 Macs yet. The release binary will still work under Rosetta, which should provide enough performance, but if you use Python/etc plugins, you need to make sure you have x86 versions of Python/etc installed (which is still the default for Homebrew as of this release).\r\n\r\nMacVim is buildable under Apple Silicon, so if you need a native binary, you could build it yourself by downloading the source from the Github repository. See #1136 for progress on releasing a universal app for Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\nGithub Discusisons\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nMacVim has enabled the Github Discussions feature, which serves as a good spot for general discussions and questions. See https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/discussions/1130 and check it out!\r\n\r\nFixes\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- Launching MacVim from the Dock with locales that use \",\" for decimal separators now works correctly. #11 (Vim 8.2.1738)\r\n- `WinBar` menus (which are used by plugins like vimspector) now work properly and don't create dummy menu items. #918\r\n- Using `:browse tabnew` no longer crashes MacVim in terminal mode.  #1107 (Vim 8.2.1842)\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- Scripting languages versions:\r\n    - Python is now built against 3.9, up from 3.8.\r\n    - Lua is now built against 5.4, up from 5.3.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Compatibility</summary>\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n====================\r\n\r\nRequires macOS 10.9 or above.\r\n\r\nScript interfaces have compatibility with these versions:\r\n\r\n- Lua 5.4\r\n- Perl 5.18\r\n- Python2 2.7\r\n- Python3 3.9\r\n- Ruby 2.7\r\n</details>",
